## GIS mapping results:

All raster layers (GeoTiff format) have a pixel size of 30 m covering the 1117-km2 terrestrial area in Hong Kong in this study. The time period of 1973–2022 was divided into 10 five-year periods in the mapping process. 

*   **HabitatMapHK_6class_yyyy-yyyy.tif**: Raster data showing the 6 habitat classes mapped in this study. Pixel values range from 1 to 6 representing woodland, shrubland, grassland, barren land, built-up area, and water respectively.

*   **HabitatMapHK_EstimatedArea.csv**: Area coverage (km2) of different habitat classes, as well as their confidence intervals, as mapped in this study. 
  
*   **HabitatMapHK_6class_ArcGISsymbology.lyrx**: Used to apply the suggested symbology in ArcGIS Pro, as shown in the figure below.

*   **ClassificationProbability_yyyy-yyyy.tif**: The probability values belonging to each class for every pixel. They were the intermediate products generated from the classification workflow and used to determine the final class with the highest probability and compute the forest index in this study. The sum of probabilities for all six classes is equal to 1. A scale factor of 10000 was applied to the GeoTiff files for storage convenience. 

*   **HabitatMapHK_8class_yyyy-yyyy.tif**: Based on the 6-class outputs, two more classes are added in this product, including wetland (pixel value 7) and plantation (pixel value 8), to serve as inputs for the habitat quality model.

*   **HabitatQualityHK_yyyy-yyyy.tif**: Habitat quality maps produced in this study. The pixel value is a continuous variable ranging from 0 to 1, with 1 meaning the highest habitat quality.
